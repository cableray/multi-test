Works as follows (or will when done)

Parses command line args

if num_procs is > 1
	Uses Runtime.exec() on itself to spawn copies of its self, but with the num_procs argument as 1
else
	creates the required number of threads of the appropriate type.

IOThreads Sleep for a random amount of time, simulate waiting on an I/O device

CPU threads count up to a specified number, and don't sleep, so will execute until preempted (require the java implementation to use preemptive kernel threads)

Both thread types store the elapsed time it took to complete their tasks

After threads are done, the parent should output their data (probably to a file).
